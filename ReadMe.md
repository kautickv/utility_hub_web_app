# AWS Serverless Utility Hub: My Tech Toolkit

Hey there! Welcome to the Utility Hub. I've put together some cool software tools that I find super useful. Made this for fun, and thought I'd share with friends and family. Feel free to check it out and let me know what you think. Enjoy!

## Usage
As this is a web application hosted on AWS, there is no installation necessary for the end user. Developers looking to run a local version of the app will need to install Node.js and React.js, and configure AWS CLI with the appropriate permissions.

## Deployment
This project uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). New changes can be deployed by creating a new Pull request to the main branch, and commenting "Deploy" in the comment section of the PR
## Getting Started

## Improvements
1. UI & UX: From a usability perspective, providing feedback (like a toast notification) after successful operations like saving a configuration could be a good touch.

## Current Issues

1. Every time the Terraform script is applied, a new layer is created irrespective of whether changes have been made to the layer. This can consume a lot of storage and cost money.
